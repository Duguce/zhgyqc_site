*On November 22, 2025, I attended the **2nd Open Source Technology Academic Conference** held at the Beijing E-Town International Convention & Exhibition Center. It was a privilege to witness the official inauguration of the **CAST Open Source Innovation Committee**. The event brought together experts and developers to discuss the future of the open-source ecosystem, and I gained valuable insights into the latest community developments and industrial applications.*
